### Google Closure Library, what's in it?
[Google Closure Library][] is a JS library used by Google in most of its
JavaScript-heavy projects.  In this folder I dumped all of the
`goog.debug`-related things, because I think it's really interesting to read.

TODO: write up the conclusions I came up with once I read this stuff.
