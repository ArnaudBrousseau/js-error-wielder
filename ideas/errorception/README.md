### Errorception, what's in it?
[Errorception][] is a company offering (surprise!) JS error reporting. Claimed
features, from their website (I bolded the ones I was curious about):

* __High performance by design__
* __We don't rewrite your code__
* __Smart grouping of errors__
* __Automatic ignoring of errors__
* Get trends about every error
* Filter errors to your liking
* Get email alerts daily of top errors
* Manage multiple projects with ease

I briefly scanned their client-side reporting script (without un-minifying it
completely), it seems they don't do anything fancy. Badass backend? Maybe.
